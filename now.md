# Family

In 2017 I married my wife. I still firmly believe it was a good decisison for me. I can't be so sure about whether or not it was for her. (That's a joke, we're better together).

In 2021, my firstborn was born. As luck would have it, my wife and I bypased the usual waiting period required between offspring and one minute later my secondborn was born.
This turned out to be a very bad decision in the shortterm, but after a year or two, I think it was actually a good call.
They are both amazing and wonderful, and much like my wife, I do not deserve them.

Yet all 3 are mine (What can I say? I'm greedy at heart).

# Work

My time at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) comes to a close.

I'm not quite sure what comes next, but I'm looking forward to it.

# Open Source

My Open Source contributions have ebbed since joining Anthropic. I really do hope they flow soon.

# Personal

With the updates from the above, I hope it doesn't surprise you that this section has dwindled to almost none.

Outside of whatever Sanderson novel revently came out I'm mostly just doing family or work. And that is sufficient for me.

Past (and potentially future, again) hobbies include:

- Laser cutting/engraving
- Cross-stitching
- Long-distance running
