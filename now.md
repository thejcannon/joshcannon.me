# Family

In 2017 I married my wife. I still firmly believe it was a good decisison for me. I can't be so sure about whether or not it was for her. (That's a joke, we're better together).

In 2021, my firstborn was born. As luck would have it, my wife and I bypased the usual waiting period required between offspring and one minute later my secondborn was born.
This turned out to be a very bad decision in the shortterm, but after a year or two, I think it was actually a good call.
They are both amazing and wonderful, and much like my wife, I do not deserve them.

Yet all 3 are mine (What can I say? I'm greedy at heart).

# Work

My time at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) came to a close August of 2025.

My time at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) will start in September of '25. I'm pretty pleased and excited.

# Open Source

My Open Source contributions have ebbed since joining Anthropic. I really do hope they flow soon.

# Personal

Since my time with Anthropic has ended, I've found my personal interests have gotten some airtime.

I was recently obsessed with a photograph a friend of mine, Sydney Johnson, took of downtown Austin and decided
to turn it into [laser layer art](/assets/images/austin-laser.jpg). 
Since that, I've decided to work more on the laser cutting/engraving since it is a rewarding and inexpensive hobby.

Past (and potentially future, again) hobbies include:

- Cross-stitching
- Long-distance running
