# Family

In 2017 I married my wife. I still firmly believe it was a good decisison for me. I can't be so sure about whether or not it was for her. (That's a joke, we're better together).

In 2021, my firstborn was born. As luck would have it, my wife and I bypased the usual waiting period required between offspring and one minute later my secondborn was born.
This turned out to be a very bad decision in the shortterm, but after a year or two, I think it was actually a good call.
They are both amazing and wonderful, and much like my wife, I do not deserve them.

Yet all 3 are mine (What can I say? I'm greedy at heart).

My son, Theodore, is as zany as it gets - and extremely good at pattern-matching (although he doesn't know it yet).
I remember a morning where he asked me for a word and I said "I think that's called levitating", and he continued his story
by saying his imgainary friend "can levitate" (that's him following the rules of conjugation if you didn't notice).

My daughter, Dorothy, is wicked clever. There is a not a problem she has yet to give up on. When she was 2, in her first week of daycare,
her teacher told us another kid tried to take her toy so she decided to raise it up high
(not something we've ever done or encouraged at home). When that seemed like it wasn't going to work, she apparently walked to
a nearby chair and got on it, continuing to to keep the toy held high.

My wife - ohh Devon - she is so many things. I always joke that in giving her eulogy (which I hope to never give) I'd describe
her as "my best friend ... and my worst enemy". She is pours herself into supporting our family and our home, a duty she takes
very seriously and is quite good at. She was the first person who could comfortably say "no", which I realized meant
I didn't have to _guess_ at where boundaries were (imagine, healthy boundaries!). And she still is the only person who really,
lovingly, challenges me (I wouldn't be the mentally or physically healthy person I am today, by a mile, without her... 
encouragement).

# Work

My time at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) came to a close August of 2025.

My time at [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) started in September of '25. Although I'm still in my honeymoon phase,
I'm VERY excited to be here. The company is very people-oriented, and the techinology side has the right amounts
of breath and depth.

# Open Source

My Open Source contributions have ebbed since joining Anthropic. I really do hope they flow soon.

That being said I'm OK if they don't. I've found a lot of joy in my life outside of tech.

# Personal

Since my time with Anthropic has ended, I've found my personal interests have gotten some airtime.

I was recently obsessed with a photograph a friend of mine, Sydney Johnson, took of downtown Austin and decided
to turn it into [laser layer art](/assets/images/austin-laser.jpg). 
Since that, I've decided to work more on the laser cutting/engraving since it is a rewarding and inexpensive hobby.

Past (and potentially future, again) hobbies include:

- Cross-stitching
- Long-distance running
