```text
It is a period of civil war.
Rebel collectors, striking
from a hidden basement,
have won their first victory
against the evil Garbage Empire.

During the battle, Rebel
spies managed to steal secret
plans to the Garbage's
ultimate weapon, the REFERNCE
CYCLE, an bloated data
structure with enough memory to
destroy an entire planet.

Pursued by the Garbage's
sinister nodes, Princess
LALR races home aboard her
algorithm, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her people and restore
freedom to the program....
```

(that was fun)

So, hello. Welcome to my blog.

## Content

This blog exists as a place for me to collect my thoughts,
since I prefer not to have a strong social media presence.

It'll mostly be covering tech topics. Within that,
expect it to be heavily Python-centric as that's my bread-and-butter.

There will definitely be humor. Or at least attempts at it. There will be some duds and some gems. But most importantly, there will be content.

## Who is this blog for?

It's for me, honestly. You can read it, for sure, and maybe I (or someone else) might've even linked to it. But ultimately it's a place to put thoughts on digital paper so they have somewhere nice and cozy to call home.

To that end, I don't have any kind of analytics or fancy features. And I don't plan on having any.

So, have a seat, or pace around, or I dunno, just kind of lay on the floor moaning. My door is open, and I'd love if you came in, but ultimately the furniture and decor is mine.
