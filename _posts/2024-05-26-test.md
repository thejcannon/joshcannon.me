It is a period of civil war.
Rebel collectors, striking
from a hidden basement,
have won their first victory
against the evil Garbage Empire.

During the battle, Rebel
spies managed to steal secret
plans to the Garbage's
ultimate weapon, the REFERNCE
CYCLE, an bloated data
structure with enough memory to
destroy an entire planet.

sinister nodes, Princess
LinkedList races home aboard her
algorithm, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her people and restore
freedom to the program....
