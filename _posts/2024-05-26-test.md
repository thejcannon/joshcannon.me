It is a period of civil war.
Rebel collectors, striking
from a hidden basement,
have won their first victory
against the evil Garbage Empire.

During the battle, Rebel
spies managed to steal secret
plans to the Garbage's
ultimate weapon, the REFERNCE
CYCLE, an bloated data
structure with enough memory to
destroy an entire planet.

Pursued by the Garbage's
sinister nodes, Princess
LALR races home aboard her
algorithm, custodian of the
stolen plans that can save
her people and restore
freedom to the program....

(that was fun)

So, hello. Welcome to my blog.

## Content

This blog exists as a place for me to collect my thoughts,
since I prefer not to have a strong social media presence.

It'll mostly be covering tech topics. Within that,
expect it to be heavily Python-centric as that's my bread-and-butter.

There will definitely be humor. Or at least attempts at it. There will be some duds and some gems. But most importantly, there will be content.

(To be continued...)
