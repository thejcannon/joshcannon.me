# Exhibit A

After I announced I was leaving Anthropic I sent this meme to my wife and a friend:

![meme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1988e05e-90aa-4cb2-986a-0b9e0d239791)

# Exhibit B

> Thank you for taking the time to interview with \<Human>, \<Human>, and \<Human>.
> I've read their feedback and based on our discussion about salary expectations,
> which fall into the range of Principal Engineer at \<Company>,
> I've decided not to move forward with an offer at this time.

# Exhibit C

>Thanks for taking the time to speak with us about opportunities at \<Company>.
> After reviewing your candidacy with the larger team,
> it seems your background isn't an exact match for the current needs.

(this one was from me flubbing a surprise leetcode question. Oof)

# Exhibit D

> After much deliberation the team decided that it is not a great fit at this time.
> Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
> We highly encourage you to apply to other roles that may appear to be a better fit within \<Company>. 

# Exhibit E

> After talking as a team, we've made the hard decision not to move forward from here.
> I understand this is a disappointing outcome, but the reality is that we hold an exceptionally high bar
> and say no to a lot of strong candidates â€” we truly need to be blown away to move forward.

# Verdict

It's good to be confident. I'd make and send the meme again if I had to. But deep down I'm also guilty
of having felt like the meme wasn't a joke. This time I lucked out:

> Do you have a second to connect today? I've got some feedback for you :)

Next time (oh I REALLY hope there won't be a next time), I'll work hard and avoid getting any desserts.
