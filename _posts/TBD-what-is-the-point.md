- Wat is the point of...?
  - toil/struggle/imperfection

## Rough Plan

Two sections:
1. On being more productive
  - (More of the shorter-time-horizon)
  - Washing machine - good for a lot of things. Equality, did increase leisure time, economics, ...
    - More important than the internet
  - Personal Computer / Internet / cell phones

2. On a toil-free future
  - (Longer time horizon)
  - Fanless greenhouse
  - The importance of Connection
  - "The Fold"
  - Inifinite imagination, limited reality
  - Exercise
  - what is the point of a child? Would you be a child again?

3. Conclusion: The point is what you want it to be
